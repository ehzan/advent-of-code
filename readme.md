This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for the
years [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023),
and [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). All solutions are implemented
in Python.

### Usage

To execute the programs, follow these steps:

1. Place the input data for each day in the corresponding directory:
   <br>`./{year}/input/day{n}.txt`
2. Run the Python scripts to obtain the solutions:
   <br>`python3 ./{year}/day{n}.py`

\* *Replace`{year}`and`{n}`with corresponding year and day number.*

<br>Feel free to explore and use these solutions as a reference or inspiration for your own Advent of Code journey!
